## Asymmetric Roles
Typically, tabletop and digital games rely on simultaneous use of a set of abilities –- such as a continuous visual interpretation and interaction with the elements of the game or the identification of sounds that mark specific events. The ability to perceive these stimuli’s is assumed during development, creating a barrier that can discourage people with disabilities from gaining or maintaining interest in playing with others and even in playing at all. Accessibility in gaming is mostly an afterthought, creating alternative inputs, and stimuli, adapting existing features and mechanics. Amid these adaptations, the core gameplay may significantly change, the essence of the game could be lost, and the game can turn out to be no fun for anyone.

Instead of looking for a single gameplay that can be experienced by players with different abilities, we seek to explore the entwining of different gameplays as a potentially effective design choice to achieve a pleasurable game to groups of players with mixed abilities – players should be able to play the roles that best suit their abilities, regardless of their limitations.
