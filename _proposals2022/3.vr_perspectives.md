motivation: "An advantage of VR is that it enables greater immersion because users can embody their characters/avatars and perceive the environment from an egocentric (or first-person) perspective. While VR has been used for perspective-taking, this is done as a full experience where one is put in the shoes of others, usually as an empathy machine. We are interested in finding ways to experience different perspectives in the same experience (perhaps concurrently) using VR. The scenario we envision for blind people is motivated by the need to gain a greater understanding of the environment due to the absence of visual feedback. A way to provide more information to the blind user is to augment their auditory feedback channel with the actions of other characters (by looking at their perspective), helping them to understand what is happening in the scene. Ways to support these multiple perspectives could be - for instance - enabling seamlessly shifting between perspectives, or just to make the perspective of others more salient in the user's experience (a very simple example is to convey the auditory feedback of footsteps to show that a person is moving in the scene, even at distances that would not be audible to the user, but that would be visible to a sighted user). Other potential contexts could be in VR experiences directed to caregivers, where they can be given multiple perspectives (including the ones of patients or doctors) in the same experience.
"

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to design, develop and evaluate novel solutions to convey multiple perspectives in VR in a specific context (e.g., Healthcare or Accessibility for blind people). You will conduct user studies early on to engage participants in co-design sessions ensuring user engagement and representation. This work will conclude with a user study evaluating the developed set of navigation techniques."
