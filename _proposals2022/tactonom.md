motivation: "Learning for people with visual impairments relies mostly on auditory and haptic feedback, but these modalities are often used in separate. For instance, technologies to support learning braille may rely on auditory feedback (for instance on a touchscreen), or on haptics (e.g., in a sheet of paper).
The Tactonom Reader (https://www.tactonom.com/en/tactonomreader-2/) shows promise in combining the two feedback modalities to support better learning. For instance, one may explore a sheet of paper with their hand while learning braille, and receive auditory feedback about their exploration.
Despite the potential of Tactonom Reader, litle is known about its potential to support learning activities, which we will explore in this thesis."

work: " In this project you will explore the potential of the Tactonom Reader  to assist people with visual impairments in learning different competencies.
You will be challenged to design, develop and evaluate novel applications that can leverage the Tactonom Reader.  You will conduct user studies early on to engage stakeholders in co-design sessions ensuring user engagement and representation."
