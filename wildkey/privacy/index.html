    <h2>Collected information</h2>
    <p>
      Our keyboard collects a wide variety of metrics for research purposes whenever the user is writing using the keyboard during defined study collection periods (users will be informed and give consent for data collection during these periods). We define a session as the user opening, writing and closing the keyboard in any and all applications. No raw text is ever stored on-device or in the cloud, nor any data that would allow its reconstruction. All metrics are calculated on the device, per text-entry trial, and only processed data is stored. Below is a list of all the metrics:
