I completed my BSc in Informatics Engineering in 2021, in University Autónoma de Lisboa. I’m currently getting my MSc also in Informatics Engineering in Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa. My main interests revolve around game design and sports so I’m now going to be working with Tech & People in Virtual Reality in Sports for Blind People, for my thesis.
