I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in data science at Faculdade de Ciencias and work beside that at this research group on Parkinson’s disease prediction from mobile phone typing data. Before that, I finished my bachelor’s in biomedical engineering in Austria, where I gathered my first insights into data science and engineering.

In my spare time, I love to go surfing or to get a good espresso in the sun.
