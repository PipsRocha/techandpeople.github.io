I completed my BSc degree in 2017 and my MSc degree in 2020 both in Information Systems and Computer Engineering in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon. During my MSc thesis, I researched on an accessible tangible programming kit for visually impaired children. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Accessibility at the Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon.
