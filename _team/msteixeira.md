Currently, I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler - Italy. I completed my MSc in Computer Science (2018) and BSc in Internet Systems (2016) at the Federal University of Santa Maria - Brazil. During both, MSc and Bsc, I participated in exchange programs, undertaking further courses related to computer science at Brock University - Canada. My research interests include dialogue systems, automated planning and information management directed to healthcare problems.
