I am currently getting a MSc degree in Informatics Engineering at the Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon, right after finishing my BSc in Informatics Engineering at University of Madeira.

I partnered with Tech&People for my MSc thesis, which will revolve around Inclusive Gaming. I have already worked with serious games before, having developed a 2D game for interactive tables as a mean of rehabilitation for post-stroke patients, as part of my BSc final project.

My main interests are Game Design, Human-Computer Interaction and Mobile Computing.
