I completed my Master’s degree in Informatics in 2017 at the <i>Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon</i> and my BSc degree in Information and Communication Technologies in 2015 at the same institution. During my Master’s, I developed <i>Scrapbook</i>, a web application that enables biographical and personalised reminiscence therapy for people with dementia. This project led to further research, as I became a hired researcher at <i>LASIGE</i>. A period in which <i>Scrapbook</i> grew into a cognitive stimulation platform and a bridge between people with dementia, psychologists and caregivers.

In 2018 I moved to <i>Open Lab</i>, <i>Newcastle University</i>. Extending the previous work of the lab, we designed a solution to support the self-management of the symptoms of the  Parkinson’s disease, namely with the creation of a mobile application that enables, among other things, the creation of personalized cues in a wearable device.

I am currently working in my PhD at the <i>Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon</i>, with a focus on <b>personalization of user interfaces</b>. I have been studying the factors that prevent greater adoption of third-party personalization mechanisms and exploring different personalization solutions.

My main research interests are human-computer interaction, accessibility, personalization, and pervasive healthcare. My goal has been to create useful and usable technologies to improve people’s quality of life.
