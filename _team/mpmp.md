I completed my BSc in Audiovisual And Multimedia in 2015. Worked a few years in Television and later pursued MSc on Informatics, which I’m currently finishing. My MSc thesis involves the investigation of the challenges that blind people experience when using virtual environments and the testing of techniques to help them navigate independently in these environments.
