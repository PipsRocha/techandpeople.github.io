I completed my BSc in 2016 and my MSc in 2018, both on Informatics Engineering.
During the second year of my Masters I worked with data-driven healthcare for capturing and showing with rich visualization Parkinson's patients fluctuations through the day.
During that time I had my first contact with research, I built DataPark, a platform with the focus on rich visualization of data collected in free-living.
After that I have been continued working with DataPark improving what I have already done and focusing also on clinical evaluation.
In 2019 I started my PhD that focus on Parkinson's Disease. More precisely, my research goal is to improve the informaton available for both clinicians and patients.
