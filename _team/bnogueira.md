I completed my BSc degree in Biology in 2020, in Instituto Superior de Agronomia.
While I pondered about what I wanted to do for my Masters I did a Postgraduate Specialization 
in Statistics Applied to Biology and Health Sciences, in FCUL, where i had some informatics courses
and contacted with people from the field.
I found it to be a very interesting and comprehensive area that i could combine with my previous education, in future projects.
I am now starting my 2nd year of the MSc in Informatics and I will be working on my thesis regarding inclusive robots, which i am very excited for.
