I completed my BSc degree in 2015 and my MSc degree in 2017 both in Informatics Engineering at Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon.
During my MSc thesis I worked on an approach that superimposes a virtual overlay to all other interfaces ensuring interface consistency by re-structuring how content is accessed in every screen.

I am currently a hired researcher at LASIGE.
My main interest is mobile accessibility.
