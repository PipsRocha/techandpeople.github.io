I completed my BSc degree in Informatics Engineering at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. I am now a MSc student in Informatics Engineering in the specialization curricular grouping of Human-Computer Interaction, in the same institution. My MSc thesis consists of developing virtual environments for inclusive online conferences and meetings.
