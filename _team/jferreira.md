I completed my BSc degree in Computer Science at the Universidade Lusíada de Lisboa in Belém. I am now a MSc student in Computer Science in the specialization curricular grouping of Artificial Intelligence, in the Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa. Despite Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning always being my favorite courses in college, one of my greatest passions has always been psychology and how to combine informatics with this field. Because of this, my MSc thesis focus on creating VR environments for therapy exposure in children and adolescents.
