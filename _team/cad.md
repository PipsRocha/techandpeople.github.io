I am an associate professor at the Department of Informatics, Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon and a researcher at LASIGE where I lead the Accessibility and Ageing research line.

My main area of research is Human-Computer Interaction with a strong emphasis on Accessibility. My work in this area for more than 10 years, has focused on finding ways to ease the access to interactive systems for populations with special needs, permanent or temporary. My approach to this challenging problem has evolved to believing that each user is unique, which led me to focus on two complementary solutions: adaptation and multimodality.
