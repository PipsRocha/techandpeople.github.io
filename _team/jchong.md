I completed my BSc degree in 2018 and my MSc degree in 2020, both in Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering at the Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon. My thesis was developed at the University of Oulu, Finland. The aim was to compare several feature selection and machine learning algorithms for physical activity classification, using 3D raw acceleration data.
