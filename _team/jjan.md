I am currently a MSc student of Informatics Engineering - Specialization in Human Computer Interaction at Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon. During High School, I have been in small internships in the Electronics field, which sparked my interest in technological investigation. The area I have interest is human-computer interaction, in particular regarding accessibility issues.
