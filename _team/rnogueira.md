I completed my BSc in Informatics Engineering in 2019 and now I'm currently getting my MSc also in Informatics Engineering. After working on object detection with drones for my final BSc project, I'm now going to be working with Tech & People in Virtual Reality in Sports for Blind People, for my thesis.

My main interests revolve around technology, game design and sports.
