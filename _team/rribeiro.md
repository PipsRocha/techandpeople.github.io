Started the road on computer science on high school, where I finished the Professional Technical Course of Computer Equipment Management. To access the continuation of studies and obtain a wider range of subjects in the area, i did the Higher Technical Professional Course in Web Programming, Devices and Mobile Applications at Escola Superior de Tecnologia de Setúbal in Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal (IPS/ESTSetúbal). Out of curiosity about how the insertion of computer sciences in health is carried out, I took a BSc degree in Biomedical Technology in the IPS/ESTSetúbal in 2020. Worked for almost 2 years on a company that exclusively dedicated to Assistive Technology (AT), where i got my first touch with accessibility and Human-Computer Interaction. Currently i am starting my 2nd year of the MSc in Computer Science where my dissertation is about Orientation and Mobility for people with visual impairments, which i am very excited for.
