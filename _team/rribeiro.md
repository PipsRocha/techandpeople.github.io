I began my career in computer science during high school, where I completed a Professional Technical Course in Computer Equipment Management. Seeking to broaden my knowledge in this field, I pursued a Higher Technical Professional Course in Web Programming, Devices, and Mobile Applications at the Escola Superior de Tecnologia de Setúbal within the Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal (IPS/ESTSetúbal). My curiosity about the intersection of computer science and healthcare led me to obtain a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Technology from IPS/ESTSetúbal in 2020.


For the past two years, I have worked in the field of Assistive Technology (AT), which has allowed me to gain valuable experience in accessibility and Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I am in my second year of pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on locomotion techniques for blind people in virtual reality. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to this important area of research and development.
