I am a research assistant at LASIGE, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa (FCUL). I received my MSc in Computer Science in 2023, from FCUL. I have worked for two years in Assistive Technology (AT) at a company specializing in support technologies for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), which has allowed me to gain valuable experience in accessibility and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My main research interests include HCI, developing and testing usable and accessible virtual reality systems. My research focuses on accessible virtual reality for people with visual impairments, in particular in supporting navigation within virtual environments. I hold a BSc in Biomedical Technology from Escola Superior de Tecnologia do Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal.
