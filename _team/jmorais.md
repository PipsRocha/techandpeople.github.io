I completed my BSc in Informatics Engineering in 2021 and I’m currently a MSc student also in Informatics Engineering in the specialization curricular grouping of Games and Virtual Environments. My main interests are gamification and how games can leverage self-development, self-care and improve interpersonal relationships. In my spare time, I'm always learning and doing different things, but mostly I'm focused on music.
