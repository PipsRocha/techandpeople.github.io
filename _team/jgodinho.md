I completed my BSc degree in 2021 in Informatics Engineering at Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon.
I am currently doing my MSc degree in the same field with a major in Games and Virtual Spaces.

Ever since I was a kid I knew I wanted to work in entertainment in a way that allowed me to express myself both creatively and technically. I always pictured myself doing something akin to either visual effects or creating 3D models or being heavily involved in the creation of games.

Through the little experience I have, I can safely say both the process of game design and development are my cup of tea. I look forward to keep chasing my passion through my thesis, Shared Gameplay Loops.
