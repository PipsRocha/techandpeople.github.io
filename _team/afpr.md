I received my PhD with distinction and honour in 2020 with the topic of Human-Powered Smartphone Assistance for Blind People. The last six years have been dedicated to developing and evaluating mobile services, applications and platforms for a variety of contexts and user groups (e.g. people with visual and/or motor impairments people experiencing homelessness). I am an HCI researcher interested in how technology can and is leveraged in accessibility, health and gaming.
