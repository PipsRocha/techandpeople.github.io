I completed my BSc degree in Computer Science at the Universidade Lusíada de Lisboa. I am now a MSc student in Computer Science in the specialization curricular grouping of Artificial Intelligence, in the Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa. Although Artificial Intelligence is of great interest to me, Game Design and Development has always been my passion and so my MSc thesis consists of investigating and developing game mechanics for real world interactions.
