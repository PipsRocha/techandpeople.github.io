 alt-text: "The top of the image represents the programming area where the user has a box with tangible blocks, the PC, a webcam and builds the sequence of instructions. The child says the word start so that the instructions are executed. The bottom of the image represents the execution area where another user has the Dash robot with audio feedback, a checkered map with tactile references in all lines, and a box with various obstacles." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "We propose the design of a programming environment that leverages asymmetric roles to foster collaborative computational thinking activities for children with visual impairments, in particular mixed-visual-ability classes. The multimodal system comprises the use of tangible blocks and auditory feedback, while children have to collaborate to program a robot. We conducted a remote online study, collecting valuable feedback on the limitations and opportunities for future work, aiming to potentiate education and social inclusion."
