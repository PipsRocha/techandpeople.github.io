 alt-text: "Colorful cartoon representation of the role's workspace and its elements. On the top, two separated blue backgrounds represent the remote environment connected by Wi-Fi. On the left, the map explorer's workspace with the LEGO-based map, an Ozobot Evo, a yellow crate, and a PC. On the right, the block commander's workspace with the PC is connected to the magic box with the four types of coding blocks inside. On the bottom, a yellow rectangle background represents the co-located environment with the map explorer's workspace on the left, with the LEGO-based map, an Ozobot Evo, and a yellow crate. In the middle, is the PC they both share. On the right, connected to the PC, the magic box with the four types of coding blocks inside." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "We investigated the tradeoffs between remote and co-located collaboration through a tangible coding kit. We asked ten pairs of mixed-visual ability children to collaborate in an interdependent and asymmetric coding game. We contribute insights on six dimensions - effectiveness, computational thinking, accessibility, communication, cooperation, and engagement - and reflect on differences, challenges, and advantages between collaborative settings related to communication, workspace awareness, and computational thinking training. Lastly, we discuss design opportunities of tangibles, audio, roles, and tasks to create inclusive learning activities in remote and co-located settings."
