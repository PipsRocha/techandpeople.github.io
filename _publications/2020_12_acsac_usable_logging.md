# short description of the publication
description: "Users are susceptible to privacy breaches when people close to them gain physical access to their phones. We present logging as a security response to this threat, one that is able to accommodate for the particularities of social relationships. To this end, and explore the feasibility of the logging approach, we present a prototype developed for Android that continuously gathers user interactions and translates them into human-readable units."
