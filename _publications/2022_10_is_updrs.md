# short description of the publication
description: "In our work, we try to estimate the MDS-UPDRS part III score from accelerometer data. We collected data from 74 patients using the Axitvity AX3 device both on the wrist and lower back. We did experiments with different models, features, and windows size. We achieved a 4.26 Mean Absolute Error on the on left out 10% data using both devices with a 2.5-second sliding window and a random forest model for prediction. We contribute with a comparison of the performed experiments and provide, according to our experiments, the optimal models for MDS-UPDRS part III estimation using only accelerometer data."
