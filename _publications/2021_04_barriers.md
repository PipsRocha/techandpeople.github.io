# short description of the publication
description: "We performed an online survey of 258 social network users and a follow-up interview conducted with 20 of them - 7 of them self-reporting blind and 13 sighted users without a disability. Results show how the different approaches being employed by major platforms are still not sufficient to properly address social media accessibility. Our findings reveal that mainstream users are not aware of the possibility and the benefits of adopting accessible practices. From the general perspectives of end-users experiencing accessible practices, concerning barriers encountered, and motivational factors, we also discuss further approaches to create more user engagement and awareness."
