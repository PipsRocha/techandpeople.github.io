# short description of the publication
description: "We present stories of research articulation, of researchers as articulated, and as researchers articulating, gesturing toward a crip HCI. Disability is a plural, fluid, transitory, embodied cultural experience. While crip theoretics of HCI are best shaped by disabled scholars, a crip practice affords and demands a broader uptake. The particulars and nuances of a crip HCI are still forming among the disabled HCI researchers in collaboration today. However, this practice of articulation within disabled community, disabled space, and disabled consciousness is an essential and ongoing process toward a more equitable, more just, more humane HCI practice."
