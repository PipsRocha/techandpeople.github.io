# short description of the publication
description: "Poor eating habits are one of today’s significant menaces to public health. Child obesity is increasing, is a concerning reality, and needs to be appropriately addressed. However, most behavior change programs do not consider the needs of parents and their children, their profiles, and environments in the design of this type of intervention. We present the results of a workshop with dietists and clinical psychologists, professionals that deal with different parents and their children’s dietary problems, to understand parents’ profiles, attitudes, and perceptions. The main contributions of this study are a set of personas, daily scenarios, and design considerations regarding behavior change programs that can be used to guide the creation of new digital programs. This formative contribution is of interest to researchers and practitioners designing digitized behavior change programs targeted at parents to improve their children’s habits."
