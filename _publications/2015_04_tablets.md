 alt-text: "The QWERTY keyboard an the characters spatial position in the 3d audio space. Characters are given an audio spatial position accordingly to their location on the keyboard. They are grouped according to the vertical columns of the keyboard (e.g. Q and A; then W, S and Z), resulting in 10 different spatial locations separated by 20º. For example A is heard on the far left (180º) while N is heard more on the right side (60º) allowing for simultaneous speech signals." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Our system combines spatial and simultaneous audio feedback with multitouch selection techniques to mimic traditional two-hand keyboard interaction. SpatialTouch enables blind users to rest their idle hand on a key (e.g. F or J), while simultaneously exploring the keyboard with their active hand and receiving auditory feedback about the character location."
