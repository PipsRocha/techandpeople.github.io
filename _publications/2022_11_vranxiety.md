# short description of the publication
description: "We conducted a narrative review of studies focused on using VR to elicit empathy. Considering the synthesized literature, we identified three contexts where VR systems have been used as a tool to study empathic behavior, namely: 1) to promote pro-environmental behavior; 2) to promote prosocialbehavior  toward specific social groups (e.g., refugees); and 3) to medical training to promote empathy and more in-depth knowledge of clinical condition"
