The democratization of sensing wearable technologies opened several possibilities in the continuous
monitoring of people in their homes. We developed a platform where usable reports are presented to clinicians, 
particuarly in the context of Parkinson's disease monitoring. The presented information originates from accelerometer sensors.

## Abstract
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is also characterized by its motor fluctuations throughout the day. This makes clinical assessment to be hard to accomplish in an appointment as the patient status at the time may be largely different from his condition two hours before. Clinicians can only evaluate patients from time to time, making symptom fluctuations difficult to discern. The emergence of wearable sensors enabled the continuous monitoring of patients out of the clinic, in a free-living environment. Although these sensors exist and they are being explored in a research setting, there have been limited efforts in understanding which information and how it should be presented to non-technical people, clinicians (and patients). To fill this gap, we started by performing a focus group with clinicians to capture the information they would like to see devised from free-living sensors, and the different levels of detail they envision. Building on the insights collected, we developed a data-driven platform, DataPark, that presents usable visualizations of data collected from a wearable tri-axial accelerometer. It enables report parameterization and includes a battery of state-of-the-art algorithms to quantify physical activity, sleep, and clinical evaluations. A two-month preliminary deployment in a rehabilitation clinic showed that patients feel rewarded and included by receiving a report, and that the change in paradigm is not burdensome and adds information for clinicians to support their decisions.
