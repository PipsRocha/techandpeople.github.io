description: "We present WildKey, an Android keyboard toolkit that allows for the usable deployment of in-the-wild user studies. WildKey is able to analyze text-entry behaviors through implicit and explicit text-entry data collection while ensuring user privacy. We detail each of the WildKey's components and features, all of the metrics collected, and discuss the steps taken to ensure user privacy and promote compliance."
