# short description of the publication
description: "This paper aims to describe the children’s dietary pattern at baseline of the SmartFeeding4Kids (SF4K) program, focusing on the intake of added sugars, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. We conclude that Fruit was the group with the highest daily intake among children, followed by added sugar foods. All children did not meet calcium, vitamin B12 and vitamin D intake recommendations. Our findings further justify the need for dietary interventions in this field, to improve young children’s diets."
