# short description of the publication
description: "Following the success of open software repositories, we present a novel community-based customization system where users can: 1) customize UIs for the self and others -- using a customization toolkit; 2) use and further adapt public customization templates -- found in an online repository; or 3) request customization assistance. We explored this concept in the context of Web technologies by developing GitUI. GitUI was iteratively developed and evaluated over two deployment phases. In a two-phase study (n=9), experts and non-experts 1) used, for two weeks, the customization toolkit; and 2) explored the repository."
