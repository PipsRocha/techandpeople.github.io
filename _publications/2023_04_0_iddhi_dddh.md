# short description of the publication
description: "This position paper focuses on the democratization of data-driven healthcare and addresses three key topics: data availability and clinical utility, agency and negotiation, and data minimization. We refer to our prior work on two projects, DataPark and Cue Band, as examples of efforts to democratize healthcare data. We propose new ideas for exploring these topics and promoting the democratization of healthcare data."
