# short description of the publication
description: "Value Sensitive HRI is a method based on design principles that consider the interleaved, dynamic, and sometimes conflicting stakeholders' values in human-robot interaction. We discuss how this approach will help design technology that better meets the values of all the stakeholders that surround a human-robot interaction and can even transfer agency from robots to people. We aim to share early insights regarding possible social impacts, identify under-explored real-world approaches and perspectives, and discuss future implementation challenges and guidelines for the shift to Value Sensitive HRI."
