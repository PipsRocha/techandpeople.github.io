# short description of the publication
description: "We investigated the feasibility and rehabilitation potential of a new design approach to create highly realistic interactive virtual environments for MCI patients’ neurorehabilitation. Through a participatory design protocol, a neurorehabilitation digital platform was developed using images captured from a Portuguese supermarket (NeuroVRehab.PT). NeuroVRehab.PT main features (e.g., medium-size supermarket, use of shopping lists) were established accordingly to a shopping behavior questionnaire filled in by 110 older adults. Seven health professionals used the platform and assessed its rehabilitation potential, clinical applicability and user-experience."
