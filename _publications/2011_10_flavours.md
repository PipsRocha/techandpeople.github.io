description: "We present a study with 13 blind people consisting of a touch screen text-entry task with four
different methods. Results show that different abilities (spatial ability, tactile perception, ...) have significant impact on performance and that this impact is related with the different methods' demands. These variations acknowledge the need of accounting for individual characteristics and giving space for difference, towards inclusive design."
