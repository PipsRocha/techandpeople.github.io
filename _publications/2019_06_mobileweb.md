# short description of the publication
description: "Accessing the Web with mobile devices, either through a browser or a native application, has become more than a perk; it is a need. Such relevance has increased the need to provide accessible mobile webpages. In this work, we focus our attention on the challenges of mobile devices for accessibility, and how those have been addressed in the development and evaluation of mobile interfaces and contents."
