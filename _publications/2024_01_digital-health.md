description: "**Introduction**: Computer confidence and computer self-efficacy can impact an individual’s perceived ease of use and useful- ness of technology, ultimately determining adherence to digital healthcare services. However, few studies focus on assessing the impact of non-clinical factors on the efficacy and adherence to digital healthcare platforms. 

**Objective**: We aimed to analyse the role of non-clinical factors (i.e. computer confidence and computer self-efficacy) in the interaction experience (IX) and the feasibility of a digital neuropsychological platform called NeuroVRehab.PT in a group of older adults with varying levels of computer confidence.
**Methods**: Eight older adults (70.63 ± 6.1 years) evaluated the platform, and data was collected using the Think-Aloud method and a semi-structured interview. Sessions were audio-recorded and analysed through an inductive-deductive informed Thematic Analysis protocol. This study was conducted according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines.

**Results**: Three main themes were identified (Interaction Experience, Digital Literacy, and Attitudes toward NeuroVRehab.PT). Computer anxiety and fear of making errors were not uncommon, even among older adults who perceive themselves as confident in technology use, and negatively impacted IX. Moreover, some game elements (e.g. three-star system, progres- sion bar) were not intuitive to all participants, leading to misleading interpretations. On the other hand, human support and the platform’s realism seemed to impact participants’ IX positively.

**Conclusions**: This study shed light on the barriers raised by non-clinical factors in adopting and using digital healthcare services by older adults. Furthermore, a critical analysis of the platform’s features that promote user adoption is done, and suggestions for overcoming limitations are presented."
