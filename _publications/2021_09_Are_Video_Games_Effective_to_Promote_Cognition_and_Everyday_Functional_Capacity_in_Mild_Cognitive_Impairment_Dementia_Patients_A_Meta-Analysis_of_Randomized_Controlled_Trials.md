description: "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are associated with increased age. MCI is a clinical entity described as a transitional state between normal cognition and dementia. Video games (VGs) can potentially promote cognition and functional capacity since multiple cognitive domains are recruited during gameplay. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the efficacy of VGs as therapeutic tools, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to analyze the impact of VGs on cognition and functional capacity outcomes in MCI/dementia patients. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis study (PROSPERO [CRD42021229445]). PubMed, Web of Science, Epistemonikos, CENTRAL, and EBSCO electronic databases were searched for RCT (2000-2021) that analyzed the impact of VGs on cognitive and functional capacity outcomes in MCI/dementia patients. Nine studies were included (n = 409 participants), and Risk of Bias (RoB2) and quality of evidence (GRADE) were assessed. Data regarding attention, memory/learning, visual working memory, executive functions, general cognition, functional capacity, quality of life were identified, and pooled analyses were conducted. An effect favoring VGs interventions was observed on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (MD = 1.64, 95%CI 0.60 to 2.69). Although promising, the effects observed should be interpreted with caution since serious methodological shortcomings were identified in the studies included. Nonetheless, the effect observed is higher than the minimum clinically important difference (1.4 points) established to MMSE. Future studies on the current topic urge. Recommendations for the design and conduction of cognitive RCT studies are presented."
