 alt-text: "A blind user exploring the table top with one finger on each hand. The tabletop has a frame above holding a Kinect sensor that is detecting the user's fingers."

description: "We report on a user study with 14 blind participants performing common touchscreen interactions using one and two-hand exploration. We investigate the exploration strategies applied by blind users when interacting with a tabletop. We identified six basic strategies that were commonly adopted and should be considered in future designs. We finish with implications for the design of accessible large touch interfaces."
