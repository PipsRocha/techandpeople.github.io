# short description of the publication
description: "Game-based interventions (GBI) have been used to promote health-related outcomes, including cognitive functions. Criteria for game-elements (GE) selection are insufficiently characterized in terms of their adequacy to patients’ clinical conditions or targeted cognitive outcomes. This study aimed to identify GE applied in GBI for cognitive assessment, training or rehabilitation. A systematic review of literature was conducted. Papers involving video games were included if: (1) presenting empirical and original data; (2) using video games for cognitive intervention; and (3) considering attention, working memory or inhibitory control as outcomes of interest. Ninety-one papers were included. A significant difference between the number of GE reported in the assessed papers and those composing video games was found (p < .001). The two most frequently used GE were: score system (79.2% of the interventions using video games; for assessment, 43.8%; for training, 93.5%; and for rehabilitation, 83.3%) and narrative context (79.2% of interventions; for assessment, 93.8%; for training, 73.9% and for rehabilitation, 66.7%). Usability assessment was significantly associated with six of the seven GE analyzed (p-values between p ≤ 0.001 and p. = 027). The use of GE that act as extrinsic motivation promotors (e.g., numeric feedback system) may jeopardize patients’ long-term adherence to interventions, mainly if associated with progressive difficulty-increase of gaming experience. Lack of precise description of GE and absence of a theoretical framework supporting GE selection are important limitations of the available clinical literature."
