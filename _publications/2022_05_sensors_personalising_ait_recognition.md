While most bars are comparable, at around 0.85, for participants P10, P11, and P18, the general model bar is at around 0.75 with the personalised bar achieving similar values as the in the other participants" # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "We compare general machine learning (CNN and NN) methods with a fine-tuned personalised version of each one of them. This approach enables a model to be trained with a not-so-large general model, and then personalised with individual data in a fine-tuning step. We showed that the latter improved the overall accuracy by 3.5% for the NN, and 5.3% for the CNN, and that those that were outliers (i.e., with the worst accuracy) in the results of the general version of the models were on par with the recognition accuracy expected from the larger group."
