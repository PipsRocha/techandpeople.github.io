# short description of the publication
description: "There has been an increase of behavior change applications, particularly in the areas of nutrition and fitness. Whereas most applications are focused on self-reporting by adults, there is limited work on designing digital programs for parents to improve their children’s food habits. In this paper, we present SmartFeeding4Kids, a digital platform co-designed within a team of psychologists, nutritionists, designers, and computer scientists, for nutritional behaviour change of children aged 2 to 6 years old. We present the main elements of our application, and main iterations of their design. Namely, we focus on mechanisms for user engagement (avatar, badges, notifications, and personalized feedback), 24-h food recall adapted to parent reporting, and overall digital workflow of the program."
