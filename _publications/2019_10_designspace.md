 alt-text: "Radar chart with the 7 axis of the design space and their ordinal values: Interruption (interruptable, conditional, continuous), Confidence (dynamic, static), Output (implicit, explicit), Selection (single, multiple), Cardinality (one, two, three), Concurrency (sequentual, concurrent), and Notification (always, threshold)."

description: "Word completion interfaces are ubiquitously available in mobile virtual keyboards; however, there is no prior research on how to design these interfaces for screen reader users. In addressing this, we propose a design space for nonvisual representation of word completions. The design space covers seven categories aiming to identify challenges and opportunities for interaction design in an unexplored research topic."
