 alt-text: "Three of the different accessibility features available during the user study of the Virtual Environment. The first navigational task demonstrates that the avatar has to reach an objective, a cube. On the fourth task, players have to overcome the fence that is blocking their path, with two torches identifying the objective's directions and the length of the door to the next room. And on the sixth task, they can request directions to the objective, which can be done visually by following an orange line." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "We explore a set of techniques that augment or are even embedded in the game design to facilitate navigation and spatial awareness of virtual environments. We conducted a user study where seven blind participants faced a number of navigational tasks in a virtual environment with these techniques and shared their perspectives on the experience. We contribute with an exploration of a catalog of techniques used to facilitate the navigation of virtual spaces and a reflection of their impact on players' experience, highlighting avenues for future work in the field."
