 alt-text: "(a) A mobile phone with a numpad, with directional arrows on top of the numpad, and on top of a joypad. (b) Explanation of a navigation scenario. Each jump goes to the next vowel a, e, i, o, u, when you enter a vowel , then you listen to the next letters on the alphabet until you find the desired target."

description: "In this paper, we describe a long-term evaluation of the NavTap prototype, a mobile device system for the blind with a navigation text-entry method as its main component. This evaluation was performed during 19 weeks with 5 users (and 3 extra users during an iterative design phase) and, besides uncontrolled (but logged) daily usage, featured regular controlled experiments to observe the users’ evolution (Figure 1). With these experiments we were able to collect data on mobile device performance usage, particularly text-entry, but also to observe how the improvements influenced the users’ habits and interactions."
