 alt-text: "Study workflow. 3000 people with parkinson's disease are recruited. 300 will participate in an RCT with two arms, where one starts with a smartphone and other with cue.band (3 weeks), and after a period of wahsout (2 weeks) they do the other condition. They are debriefed in the end with questionnaires and an interview. 2700 participants participate in an open study providing anonymous usage data and optional feedback through the app." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "This research will deploy CueBand, a discrete and comfortable wrist-worn device designed to work with a smartphone application to support the real-world evaluation of haptic cueing for the management of drooling. We will recruit 3,000 PwP to wear the device day and night for the intervention period to gain a greater understanding of the effectiveness and acceptability of the technology within real-world use. Additionally, 300 PwP who self-identity as having an issue with drooling will be recruited into an intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of the wrist-worn CueBand to deliver haptic cueing (3-weeks) compared with smartphone cueing methods (3-weeks). PwP will use our smartphone application to self-assess their drooling frequency, severity, and duration using visual analogue scales and through the completion of daily diaries. Semi-structured interviews to gain feedback about utility of CueBand will be conducted following participants completion of the intervention."
