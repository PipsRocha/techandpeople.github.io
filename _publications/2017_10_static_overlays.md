# short description of the publication
description: We present an approach that superimposes a virtual overlay to all other interfaces ensuring interface consistency by re-structuring how content is accessed in every screen. The screen is splitted in two, dedicating half to a configurable set of static options regardless of context; while the other enables the standard content navigation gestures with the ability to re-order content and apply filters.
