# short description of the publication
description: "We conducted a narrative review focusing on both VR exposure for children and adolescents and sensors’ use for VR exposure. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) seems to have similar results to other forms of exposure. Additionally, sensors managed to obtain an objective picture, which allows the therapist to get some objective measures during therapy. Although cybersickness seems to not be a major side effect in children, other limitations such as fear of the equipment and lack of adaptability were identified."
