# short description of the publication
description: "This talk builds on more than 14 years of deep engagements and in-the-wild deployments of mobile technologies within a community of blind people. It makes the case for pervasive assistive technology researchers to be experts in their areas of study: people, and then, technology to serve and empower people."
