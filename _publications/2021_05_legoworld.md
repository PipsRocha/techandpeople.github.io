 alt-text: "Shows an overview of the system. A large LEGO base plate and on top a set of components that make up the system: the Ozobot robot, the different caps (start, end, and path), LEGO caps with top codes and tactile arrows, and a dialog between a child and the system - What's the instruction? Move Forward. How many times? Two." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "We explore how commodity objects and technologies can be repurposed to provide a multimodal programming environment that is accessible to children with visual impairments, flexible, and scalable to a variety of programming challenges. Our approach resorts to four main components: 1) a LEGO base plate where LEGO blocks can be assembled to create maps, which is flexible and robust for tactile recognition; 2) a tangible programming area where LEGOs, with 3D printed caps enriched with tactile icons, can be assembled to create a program; 3) alternatively, the program can be created through a voice conversation with the system; and 4) a low-cost {\it OzoBot Bit}new"
