description: "The current study investigated the use of gait variability in the “real world” to identify patient fatigue and daytime sleepiness. Inertial measurement units were worn on the lower backs of 159 participants (117 with six different immune and neurodegenerative disorders and 42 healthy controls) for up to 20 days, whom completed regular PROs. To address walking bouts that were short and sparse, four feature groups were considered: sequence-independent variability (SIV), sequence-dependant variability (SDV), padded SDV (PSDV), and typical gait variability (TGV) measures. These gait variability measures were extracted from step, stride, stance, and swing time, step length, and step velocity. These different approaches were compared using correlations and four machine learning classifiers to separate low/high fatigue and sleepiness. Most balanced accuracies were above 50%, the highest was 57.04% from TGV measures. The strongest correlation was 0.262 from an SDV feature against sleepiness. Overall, TGV measures had lower correlations and classification accuracies."
