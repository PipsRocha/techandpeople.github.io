description: "Recent technological advances have led to the development of sensors that can potentially connect patients and their care team beyond the traditional, and brief, clinical visit, improving accessibility and continuity of care. In this chapter, we examine the basic concepts related to sensor use in movement disorders and discuss the opportunities and challenges they represent for clinical practice and research."
