# short description of the publication
description: "We summarize and critically appraise the characteristics of technology-based gait analysis in PD and provide mean and standard deviation values for spatiotemporal gait parameters. These results provide useful information for performing objective technology-based gait assessment in PD, as well as mean values to better interpret the results."
