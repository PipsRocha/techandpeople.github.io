  alt-text: Montage of 5 screenshots, in a 3 by 2 grid, that illustrate our 2D virtual environment. The image on the upper left corner depicts a group of 4 avatars having a conversation, followed by an image that shows an interaction between 2 avatars, where the user's avatar is receiving audio notifcations with the name of the passerby. The third image from the top depicts the environment of the "Teleport" and "Auto-Walk" scenarios, where the user has access to 4 buttons disposed vertically on the top left, which indicates that there are 4 groups in the environment - Group 1, Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4. Here, the user is accessing group 1, which is shown in a popup screen next to the buttons, having "Group 1" as a title, followed by the names of the 5 participants of that group, a button to hear a conversation preview, and another button to be automatically transported to that group. In the lower-left corner, there is an image with the total view of the room. It is a large rectangular space, with a small adjacent rectangle on the upper left corner of the room. The room is bordered by walls and trees, and it is composed by 2 groups of 3 avatars, 2 groups of 5 avatars, 2 individual avatars, and the main avatar - controlled by the user. The last image illustrates the user's avatar being guided by another avatar toward a group of 3 participants. # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Social virtual environments are becoming more prevalent, replicating and sometimes replacing real-world interactions. Nowadays, such environments are not accessible and end up excluding blind people, due to their strong visual components. In this study, we designed and explored multiple navigation and feedback techniques assessing social acceptability, ease of use, and efficiency. We developed a virtual environment composed of six scenarios to analyze different navigation methods (Free Exploration, Teleport, Auto-Walk, and Co-Pilot) and awareness cues in group conversations (Audio Cues While In-Group Footsteps and In-Group Teleport), and conducted a user study with 8 blind and 8 sighted participants. Our results indicate that participants tend to privilege autonomy and room awareness over efficiency and navigation ease and disapprove of intrusive actions that may jeopardize privacy."
