 alt-text: "The WildKey Keyboard opened with the private mode highlighted (image of a lock on the top left corner of the keyboard) and the number of pending tasks on the top right of the keyboard. The keyboard is shown in a messaging app with the following exchange: No raw text is collected. Password and number fields are ignored. It also has a private mode. Lastly a second image of a smartphone shows a question with a 6 point scale propmted through WildKey." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Typing on mobile devices is a common and complex task. The act of typing itself thereby encodes rich information, such as the typing method, the context it is performed in, and individual traits of the person typing. Researchers are increasingly using a selection or combination of experience sampling and passive sensing methods in real-world settings to examine typing behaviours. However, there is limited understanding of the effects these methods have on measures of input speed, typing behaviours, compliance, perceived trust and privacy. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs of everyday data collection methods. We contribute empirical results from a four-week field study (N=26). Here, participants contributed by transcribing, composing, passively having sentences analyzed and reflecting on their contributions. We present a tradeoff analysis of these data collection methods, discuss their impact on text-entry applications, and contribute a flexible research platform for in the wild text-entry studies"
