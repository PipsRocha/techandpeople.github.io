# short description of the publication
description: "In this preliminary study, we examine the possibility of using smart glasses equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors for providing objective information on the motor state of PD patients. Data was collected from seven patients with PD with varying levels of symptom severity, who performed a total of 35 trails of the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test while wearing the glasses. Findings suggest that smart glasses have the potential for unobtrusive and continuous screening of PD patients’ gait, enhancing the medical assessment and treatment."
