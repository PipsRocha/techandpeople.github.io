# short description of the publication
description: "We presented a qualitative analysis of the expectations, fears and needs pointed by a sample of blind participants. In study 2, we implement and discuss the effect of two types of robotic assistance during the assembling task.
Results from our two studies support the usefulness of developing and introducing this form of collaborative assistive technology in the lives of people with visual impairments. Positive outcomes for users (such as an increased level of autonomy in everyday life tasks) are outlined and discussed."
