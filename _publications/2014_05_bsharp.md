 alt-text: "B# is a novel correction system for multitouch Braille input. (a) The user types the letter F holding the device with the screen facing forward using braille typing. (b) Character-level correction; the closest characters in terms of Braille distance for 2 unidentified chords. Example given with the O character, with closest characters, O,S,R,T (c) Word-level correction; top suggestions return by B# considering the letters that are at a Braille distance of one from the entered chord." # provide a short description for the image #a11y
description: "B#, a novel correction system for multitouch Braille input that uses chords as the atomic unit of information rather than characters. Experimental results on data collected from 11 blind people revealed that B# is effective in correcting errors at character-level, thus providing opportunities for instant corrections of unrecognized chords; and at word-level, where it outperforms a popular spellchecker by providing correct suggestions for 72% of incorrect words (against 38%)."
