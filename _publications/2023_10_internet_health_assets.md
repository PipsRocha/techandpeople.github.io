# short description of the publication
description: "We investigate the impacts of optimising the page selection processes of large-scale web accessibility evaluations. We conducted an automated analysis of 987 websites using the `Home+' sample method as our baseline; then compare the agreement rates of web accessibility evaluations on further sub-sampled datasets. Our findings demonstrate that strong agreement could be reached with a sub-sample of just 30% of the pages, significantly reducing the effort and resources required to conduct large-scale web accessibility evaluations."
