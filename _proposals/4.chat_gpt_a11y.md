motivation: "As explained by ChatGPT itself:
As an AI language model, I can play a significant role in improving web accessibility by addressing the needs of individuals with reading or cognitive disabilities and assisting those with visual impairments. Here's how:

Simplifying Text: I can simplify complex text, making it easier to comprehend for people with reading difficulties or cognitive disabilities.

Summarization: For individuals who have difficulty processing lengthy articles or documents, I can generate concise summaries that capture the key points and main ideas.

Relevant Topic Identification: When it comes to individuals with visual impairments, I can assist by identifying the most relevant topics or key information within a webpage. By providing concise summaries or extracting key details, I can facilitate quicker navigation through web content and enable users to locate the information they need more efficiently.

Alternative Formats: In addition to text-based assistance, I can also generate alternative formats such as audio descriptions or transcripts for visual content like images, videos, or charts.
"

work: "In this topic, you will explore how Large Language Models can be used to improve Web Accessibility, for instance by simplifying text, summarizing, identifying key topics, or providing alternative formats. Besides exploring different approaches (and prompts), understanding how users may interact with such an interface effectively is key to support an approach that integrates the AI-based responses in the webpage exploration experience."
