# short description of the publication
motivation: "Blind people want to play mainstream digital games, despite their overall inaccessibility. In our prior work, we have investigated the strategies employed by some blind gamers to overcome the barriers found in visual-centric mainstream games. One of the main untackled barriers - especially in 3D games - is the ability to deal with the perspective of the world (or camera), for instance, due to misunderstandings of the camera direction (e.g., aiming too high or too low). Still, it is unknown how the perspective of the world influences the ability to understand the environment."

work: "In this topic, you will explore the different ways a camera and avatar are controlled in games (e.g., in 1st or 3rd person perspectives) and how it influences the ability to effectively understand and navigate an environment. The work will include developing environments and games in Unity, possibly VR headsets if extending this work to a VR context, and involving blind people in user studies."
