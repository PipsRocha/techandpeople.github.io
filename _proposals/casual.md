# short description of the publication
motivation: "Entertainment as a whole in modern society started to be recognized as a fundamental part of our lives and well-being. Gaming has a long list of potential benefits including coping with anxiety, social bonding, or as a creative outlet.  While there is a vast array of options available for sighted players to play casually on their smartphones, blind players are for the most part restricted to specific audio games designed only for them. Furthermore, most developers have little idea of what to do to make their games accessible."

work: "In our group, we have been exploring how to make games more accessible. In this topic, you will have the opportunity to delve deeper into the design of Accessible Games. You will have to explore how to make each individual game accessible, identifying patterns and limitations. You will conduct user studies early on to engage stakeholders identifying challenges ensuring user engagement and representation."
