# short description of the publication
motivation: "Most approaches to monitor diseases are prescribed and led by clinicians with limited agency to patients. However, recent advances in mobile and wearable devices allow people to collect years of objective information about their health and fitness. How can this information be useful for the future of digital health and one’s healthcare?"

work: "In this work, the student will design and develop applications that allow people with Parkinson’s disease to gather and visualize meaningful and personalized information about their status. The work will also explore how this data can then be made available and useful to clinicians, at the patient’s discretion and explicit consent. Lastly, the work will explore scenarios of self-experimentation, where individuals will be able to experiment behavioural changes to their day to day and assess their impact, scientifically, following a stats-of-1 paradigm. Candidates to this project should have skills and interest in data analysis and mobile computing, and a motivation to work in a clinical context with frequent collaboration with clinicians and patients. The thesis will be supported by a scholarship of the IDEA-FAST  project."
