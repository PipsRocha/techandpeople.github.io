# short description of the publication
motivation: "The covid-19 pandemic has changed the way scientific conferences and meetings in general are done, moving from presencial to virtual interactions. While we hope the pandemic will be over soon, such virtual events - or at least hybrid - are likely to be more prevalent in society in the future. Overall, event organizers and attendees have been able to adapt to this shift, and strived to make use of immersive environments that try to replicate real-world interactions. However, such environments are not accessible and end up excluding people with disabilities (e.g., blind people or deaf and hard of hearing). In this thesis, we aim to build an inclusive virtual conference/meeting environment, built on top of the Jitsi platform, that provides an immersive and accessible experience for people with different abilities."

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to design, develop, and evaluate a novel platform for virtual meetings, built on top of an existing virtual conferencing tool (Jitsi). You will conduct user studies early on to understand the requirements of such a tool, ensuring user engagement and representation. This work will conclude with a user study evaluating the developed platform."
