# short description of the publication
motivation: "Hybrid spaces have been emerging as a way to bridge the gap between physical and virtual interactions, offering a flexible - and potentially inclusive - approach to socializing. For instance, a pair with mixed-visual abilities (one blind and one sighted person) could visit a museum where one explores it virtually while the other is in the real-world. While such hybrid environments are incorporating virtual and augmented reality technologies to enhance the user experience, they often exclude blind participants, who are unable to engage with visual stimuli used in these spaces."

work: "In this topic, you will explore how to support Inclusive Mixed-Reality experiences for people with mixed visual abilities, showcasing it in a proof-of-concept scenario (e.g., a museum, an escape room, or another option). The work will include developing environments with Unity, working with VR headsets and/or AR, and involving blind people in user studies."
