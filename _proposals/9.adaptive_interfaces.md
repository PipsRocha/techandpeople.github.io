# short description of the publication
motivation: "Webpages are frequently not adapted to users’ characteristics, and specifications for accessibility of Web pages do not necessarily guarantee a usable or satisfying Web experience, particularly for people with disabilities. In today’s UIs, we can witness support for some adaptations (e.g., zooming in and out a webpage or changing its contrast), however browsers and websites provide very restrictive options that are still manually controlled by users. When users open a webpage or application, the way in which it is adjusted to their abilities and likings is almost nonexistent."

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to investigate how to adapt interfaces based on user (and other) users past interactions. The goal of this thesis is twofold: 1) automatically create user models based on user's interactions with webpages; and 2) use that knowledge to adapt the interfaces."
