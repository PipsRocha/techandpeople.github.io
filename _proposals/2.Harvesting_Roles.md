# short description of the publication
motivation: "Gaming has the potential to prompt feelings of togetherness through a shared activity, based on challenging goals and immersive interaction. However, finding the time, or common interest within family members is often hard to impossible, limiting the opportunities for a sense of shared play."

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to create new opportunities for family members to contribute to each other play (e.g. Parents and Children). You will explore how to design asymmetric games that harvest everyday tasks from one family member as a contribution to the game of another. For example, can parent's work productivity influence a child's game, or a child's study hours influence a sibling's play? What are the implications of these dynamics? This work will explore proof-of-concepts scenarios and evaluate them with users. This work will be done in collaboration with researchers from KU Leuven, Belgium."
