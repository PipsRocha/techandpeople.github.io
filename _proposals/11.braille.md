# short description of the publication
motivation: "Overall, since the advent of touchscreen mobile devices, numerous input methods have been proposed for blind people. Braille chording approaches have been particularly effective in improving typing speed (see https://techandpeople.github.io/projects/brailleio.html). However, these approaches are normally targeted at a type of device and not adequate for one-hand usage." 

work: "In this work, you will build a new typing method that enables blind people to write Braille characters in a smartwatch by drawing the shape of the braille cell rather than chording it. First, you will collect a dataset with a broad number of participants; second, you will explore and assess different shape recognizers that are able to identify individual characters. You will integrate a braille spellchecker to improve word-level accuracy. Ultimately, this approach can be tested on other devices. The project will be developed in collaboration with an institution for blind people and researchers from IST and Northumbria University."
