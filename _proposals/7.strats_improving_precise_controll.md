# short description of the publication
motivation: "Blind people want to play mainstream digital games, despite their overall inaccessibility. In our prior work, we have investigated the strategies employed by some blind gamers to overcome the barriers found in visual-centric mainstream games. One of the main untackled barriers - especially in 3D games - is the ability to deal with the perspective of the world (or camera), for instance, due to misunderstandings of the camera direction (e.g., aiming too high or too low). This poses greater difficulties in tasks that require precision, such as aiming at a specific target."

work: "In this topic, you will explore different solutions for controlling a camera and assisting in aiming tasks, keeping in mind not only accessibility but also engagement and a sense of fairness in the game (e.g., assisting a blind user too much in a competitive game, may make the game unbalanced and unfair). The work will include developing environments and games in Unity, and involving blind people in user studies."
