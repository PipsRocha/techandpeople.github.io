# short description of the publication
motivation: "Entertainment as a whole in modern society started to be recognized as a fundamental part of our lives and well-being. Gaming has a long list of potential benefits including coping with anxiety, social bonding, or as a creative outlet. While there is a vast array of options available for playing together, players need to enjoy the same type of games."

work: "In our group, we have been exploring highly asymmetric games for shared play. In this topic, you will be challenged to find ways to create a sense of shared play between a large variety of different casual games.  You will have the opportunity to delve deeper into the design of asymmetric games and ecosystems exploring ways to expand the concepts of shared play. This work will explore a proof-of-concept ecosystem for shared play and evaluate them with users."
