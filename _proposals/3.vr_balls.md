# short description of the publication
motivation: "Virtual reality (VR) is slowly becoming mainstream, paving the way for a large number of applications in a variety of contexts, such as gaming and entertainment, education, and employee training. Despite the hype about immersive experiences that VR can offer, there are numerous accounts of its inaccessibility. In particular, VR applications rely heavily on visual feedback as an essential modality, neglecting people with visual impairments who are either being delivered with poor VR experiences or are excluded."

work: "Our recent work has focused on understanding how audio feedback can provide greater knowledge of a virtual environment to blind people, improving the accessibility of VR experiences. In this topic, you will explore how blind users can make use of acoustic tools (in this case, Balls) to improve their awareness of the environment. Examples include placing a Ball at a specific place, emitting sound, to serve as a landmark, or throwing a Ball to understand if there is open space ahead, walls, or objects. The work will include developing environments in Unity, working with VR headsets, and involving blind people in user studies."
