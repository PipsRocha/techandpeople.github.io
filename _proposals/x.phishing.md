# short description of the publication
motivation: "Phishing (pronounced: fishing) is an attack that attempts to steal your money, or your identity, by getting you to reveal personal information -- such as credit card numbers, bank information, or passwords -- on websites that pretend to be legitimate. Browsers, e-mails and app clients already try to detect phishing attacks and provide cues to the users. However, blind people miss the global perspective and visual cues provided in these warnings.They jump to content and eventually fail to be warned."

work: "In this work, the student will assess how blind people perceive current warnings and cues, and will design new ways of preventing phishing for blind people. The plan includes developing a browser extension that is able to communicate warning and alerts to blind people in a variety of relevants web applications."
