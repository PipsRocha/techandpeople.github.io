# short description of the publication
motivation: "Virtual reality is an emerging technology that is slowly becoming available to the masses at affordable prices. VR is currently used in a variety of contexts, including in sports both for recreational and training purposes. However, most VR applications (including sports related) are built with a major focus on visual information making them not accessible to blind users. In this thesis, we will investigate how to design accessible sports applications (e.g., table tennis, running, or other) for blind people, making use of VR technologies and auditory and haptic feedback.
"

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to design, develop and evaluate a novel VR sports application for blind people. You will conduct user studies early on to engage participants in co-design sessions ensuring user engagement and representation. This work will conclude with a user study evaluating the developed set of navigation techniques."
