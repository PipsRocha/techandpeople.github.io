# short description of the publication
motivation: "In recent years, conversational AI agents have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, providing virtual assistance, information retrieval, and even emotional support. These agents utilise natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand and respond to user queries and commands. While conversational AI agents have the potential to greatly enhance human-computer interactions, there is a pressing need to investigate and characterise their accessibility to ensure inclusivity and equal access for all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
Accessibility is a fundamental principle that aims to eliminate barriers and provide equal opportunities for people with disabilities. However, the accessibility of conversational AI agents has received limited attention in research and development. Understanding the accessibility challenges and potential limitations of these agents is crucial to ensure their effective and equitable use by individuals with disabilities, such as those with visual impairments, hearing impairments, motor disabilities, or cognitive limitations.
By characterising the accessibility of conversational AI agents, this research proposal seeks to identify the key factors that impact the usability and inclusiveness of these systems for individuals with disabilities. It aims to investigate how conversational AI agents handle various accessibility requirements, including providing alternative output modalities, accommodating diverse input methods, incorporating assistive technologies, and addressing potential biases or stereotypes. Furthermore, this research will explore the experiences and perspectives of individuals with disabilities in interacting with conversational AI agents, offering valuable insights into their needs, preferences, and potential areas of improvement.
Ultimately, this research endeavour will contribute to the advancement of inclusive technology design and policy-making, ensuring that conversational AI agents are accessible, usable, and empowering for individuals of all abilities."

work: "During the thesis, you will conduct a comprehensive investigation to characterise the accessibility of conversational AI agents. You will analyse existing conversational AI systems and evaluate their performance in meeting accessibility requirements. This evaluation will involve designing and conducting user studies with participants representing diverse disability groups. You will collect data on the usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction of interacting with conversational AI agents. You will also explore the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in using these agents and gather insights on potential improvements. The findings will be used to develop guidelines and recommendations for enhancing the accessibility and inclusiveness of conversational AI agents."
