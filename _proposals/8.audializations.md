motivation: "Information visualization tries to ease the understanding of complex data through the use of characteristics such as size, color, or location of elements. However, nost graphical representations of data - from simple charts to data visualizations - are not accessible to blind people. The most common solution is to provide a description of the chart, which does not enable a blind person to explore charts interactively nor to make their own interpretation of the data. In this work, we aim to explore information visualizations alongside different characteristics of audio (e.g., pitch, volume, or timbre) in order to enable blind users to explore - and perceive - complex data visualizations (or more broadly, representations) through audio.
"

work: "In this thesis, you will be challenged to design, develop and evaluate accessible visualizations that allow blind people to explore complex data.  You will conduct user studies early on to engage stakeholders in co-design sessions ensuring user engagement and representation."
