# short description of the publication
motivation: "People with neurodegenerative diseases face several motor fluctuations during the day. These are normally associated with the disease or response to medication; when medication starts to wear off, symptoms start to be more visible. Detecting these changes is relevant to assess the state of the disease but also to allow clinicians to adapt medication plans."

work: "Our group has developed data collection tools that resort to mainstream mobile devices to capture privacy-aware digital metrics about a personâ€™s typing mechanics and mobile phone usage (including location dynamics, social communication stats, etc..). This project will focus on exploring the relationship between these typing and social dynamics and established disease scales. Candidates to this project should have skills and interest in data analysis, modeling, and visualization, and a motivation to work in a clinical context with frequent collaboration with clinicians. The thesis will be supported by a scholarship of the IDEA-FAST  project."
