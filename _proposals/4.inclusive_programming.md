# short description of the publication
motivation: "Robots have been a popular research tool in education because they are attractive and relevant to learn complex concepts. The use of robots increases engagement in social and collaborative actions which may also effectively impact children's social development and learning. Besides the fact that robots are now widely available and affordable, minorities are still set apart, and we have still not reached a state where visually impaired children can autonomously interact with a robot. Also, the potential of maker technologies (DIY) to support new forms of interaction and understanding of technology may motivate and empower children in the creation of their own technology (eg, robot). Although HCI is growing in accessible making technologies for people with visual impairments, they are not yet accessible for children.
"

work: "In this project, you will focus on co-designing, with educators and children with mixed-visual-abilities, inclusive environments for situated making and introductory programming. The goal will be to create accessible making tools where children build modules to create a robot that interact with other elements and with a map where they can use programming concepts while having their own project and tangible outcomes. You will design a DIY module to afford the creation of a robot and other interactive elements and deploy it in an inclusive school and assess its impact (optionally, depending on time and confinement restrictions, deployments can be individual and shipped to the children’s home, with their parent’s cooperation).
