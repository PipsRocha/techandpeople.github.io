# short description of the publication
motivation: "The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on how technology is used in the care of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). After recovering some normality, there are several benefits to harvest. For example, telemedicine enables people in rural areas to have access to specialists more regularly. Also, it enables a triage of those that really need to go to a physical appointment. Videoconference tools, like Zoom, were the tools of the trade for remote appointments in the last year. Although they enable video conversation, they could be tweaked to better support the doctor in assessing the patient."

work: "In this thesis, you will be challenged to enrich a telemedicine videocall with interaction and monitoring capabilities on the patient and doctor side for a more effective appointment. First, you will characterize the type of assessment performed by neurologists during a routine appointment. Then, you will build plugins that enable the patient to perform tasks (e.g., following targets with their eyes, select or point to targets) and the doctor to have more information on those and other tasks (e.g., measure head movement, pupil size, hand stability) through audio and video analysis."
