motivation: "Entertainment as a whole in modern society started to be recognized as a fundamental part of our lives and well-being. Gaming has a long list of potential benefits including coping with anxiety, social bonding, or as a creative outlet. While there is a vast array of options available for playing together, players are very limited in the experiences they are able to share when there is a significant difference in skill, ability, and gaming tastes among others."

work: "In our group, we have been exploring leveraging asymmetric roles to create asymmetric games that provide opportunities for shared play. In this topic, you will have the opportunity to delve deeper into the design of Asymmetric Games and explore how to create and expand shared gameplay loops to cater to different family members."
