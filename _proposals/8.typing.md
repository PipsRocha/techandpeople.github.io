# short description of the publication
motivation: "Typing on a touchscreen has the potential to be a clinically relevant biomarker. It involves motor, perceptual, and cognitive functions. Also, it is something we do constantly throughout the day making it a good candidate for granular assessment of the user state. Recently, we built a keyboard toolkit that is able to devise metrics related to the textual and touch behaviours of participants, without compromising user's privacy (see https://techandpeople.github.io/wildkey) ." 

work: "In this thesis, you will be challenged to explore the potential for typing data as a digital phenotype, applied in several case studies. First, you will focus on exploring which measures have potential to be explored in specific diseases (e.g., Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS). Then, together with clinicians you will explore the design of usable reports (i.e. rich visualizations) that enable the quick assessment of changes. Ultimately, you will explore the classification of disease stage from typing behaviours. The project will be developed in collaboration with clinicians from national and international institutions."
