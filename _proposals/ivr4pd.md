# short description of the publication
Motivation: "People with Parkinson's disease have several motor fluctuations during the day. There are normally associated with response to medication; when medication starts to wear off, symptoms start to be more visible. Detecting these changes is relevant to assess the state of the disease but also to allow clinicians to adapt medication plans."

work: "In this project, the student will design and develop an interactive voice response system that is able to receive and place scheduled calls to patients and lead a conversation to collect meaningful objective and subjective data for disease monitoring and support. An example is the application of a clinical scale over the phone but also enabling a conversation with a conversational agent to brief the person about a medication plan and take their doubts. Candidates to this project should have skills and interest in programming and web applications, and a motivation to work in a clinical context with frequent collaboration with clinicians and patients. The thesis will be supported by a scholarship of the IDEA-FAST  project."
