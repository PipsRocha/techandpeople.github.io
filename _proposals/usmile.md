# short description of the publication
motivation: "Oral health plays a vital role in overall well-being, and preventive oral care is key to maintaining good dental hygiene. However, many people struggle to establish and maintain healthy oral care habits due to various reasons, including lack of awareness, forgetfulness, or limited access to dental care resources. There is a significant opportunity to leverage technology and develop a mobile application that promotes oral health and empowers individuals to take better care of their teeth and gums.
The development of a mobile application, Usmile, dedicated to oral health promotion, holds immense potential in revolutionising oral care practices. The application can offer a range of features, including personalised oral care plans, reminders for brushing, flossing, and dental appointments, educational resources on proper dental hygiene techniques, and interactive tools such as timers and trackers. By providing users with accessible and engaging information, Usmile can help individuals develop and sustain healthy oral care habits.
Usmile can also bridge the gap in dental health education and awareness, reaching individuals who may not have easy access to dental care resources. The application can provide information on common dental issues, tips for prevention, and guidance on seeking professional dental assistance when needed. Furthermore, Usmile can incorporate gamification elements and rewards to make oral care routines fun and motivating, encouraging users to maintain consistent habits.
By developing Usmile, we aim to promote oral health, empower individuals to take control of their dental care, and improve overall oral hygiene practices. This mobile application has the potential to enhance oral health outcomes, reduce dental issues, and contribute to better overall health and well-being.
This work will be conducted in collaboration with multiple schools of the Universidade de Lisboa: Faculdade de Medicina Dent√°ria, Faculdade de Psicologia and Faculdade de Belas-Artes."

work: "During the thesis, you will focus on the development of Usmile, a mobile application for oral health promotion. You will conduct a thorough analysis of existing oral health applications, identify key features and functionalities, and design a user-friendly interface. You will then proceed with the development of the mobile application, utilising appropriate technologies and frameworks. You will implement features such as personalised oral care plans, reminders, educational resources, and interactive tools. User testing and feedback will be collected to refine the application's functionality and user experience. The student will document the development process, challenges, and solutions in the master's thesis, showcasing the contribution of Usmile to oral health promotion."
