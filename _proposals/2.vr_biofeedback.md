motivation: "Virtual Reality allows for immersive experiences as users can embody their characters/avatars and perceive the environment from an egocentric (or first-person) perspective. This enables the creation of experiences that resemble real-life but in controlled environments, which has great potential for measuring behavioural response during exposure to situations that could otherwise be dangerous or cause distress. In this thesis, we aim to explore how realistic virtual environments can be used for diagnosis (for instance, of Alcohol Use Disorder), by using sensors to objectively assess behavioral response (e.g., hearth-rate), during exposure (in this case exposure to alcohol-related virtual environments).
"

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to design, develop and evaluate novel solutions that explore the use of immersive VR environments that induce different emotional responses to users while they are being physiologically measured (e.g., using smartwatches, physiological kits, bracelets, etc). For example, in disorder related settings (e.g., exposure to a bar and drinks to assess alcohol disorders). You will conduct user studies early on to engage stakeholders in co-design sessions ensuring user engagement and representation."
