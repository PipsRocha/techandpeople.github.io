# short description of the publication
motivation: "Digital gaming has the potential to prompt feelings of togetherness through a shared activity, based on challenging goals and immersive interaction. However, finding the time, or common interest within family members is often hard to impossible, limiting the opportunities for shared play."

work: "
In this thesis, you will be challenged to create new opportunities for family members to affect each other's routines, by designing games that spill and are augmented by real-world interactions. The goal is to explore how games can harvest everyday tasks and leisure activities from one family member as a contribution to the game of another, and vice-versa. For example, can a parent’s work productivity influence a child’s game, and, in turn, the points obtained in the game affect the parent’s leisure time (e.g., watching television)? What are the implications of these dynamics? This work will explore proof-of-concept scenarios and evaluate them with users. This work will be done in collaboration with researchers from KU Leuven, Belgium."
