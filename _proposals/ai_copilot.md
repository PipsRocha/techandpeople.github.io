# short description of the publication
motivation: "In today's digital era, the web serves as a vital platform for information dissemination, communication, and engagement. However, individuals with disabilities often face barriers in accessing web content due to inaccessible design and lack of awareness about accessibility guidelines. To promote inclusivity and ensure equal access to information, there is a pressing need to develop AI co-pilots that can assist content authors in creating accessible web content.
An AI co-pilot for authoring accessible web content can act as a virtual assistant, providing real-time guidance, suggestions, and automated checks to ensure compliance with accessibility standards and best practices. By integrating natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the co-pilot can analyse the content being authored and provide contextual recommendations to enhance accessibility, such as suggesting alternative text for images, verifying appropriate heading structure, and identifying potential colour contrast issues.
This research proposal seeks to develop an AI co-pilot specifically designed to support content authors in creating accessible web content. By providing intelligent guidance and automating accessibility checks, the co-pilot aims to empower authors, regardless of their familiarity with accessibility guidelines, to produce inclusive content that can be accessed and consumed by individuals with disabilities.
User studies involving content authors and individuals with disabilities will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness, usability, and impact of the AI co-pilot in facilitating the creation of accessible web content. The findings of this research endeavour will contribute to advancing inclusive web design practices, fostering equal access to information, and empowering content authors to proactively consider accessibility in their work."

work: "During the thesis, you will develop an AI co-pilot for authoring accessible web content. You will design and implement algorithms and models that leverage natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyse web content being authored in real-time. You will develop intelligent guidance and automated checks to ensure compliance with accessibility standards and best practices. User studies involving content authors and individuals with disabilities will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the AI co-pilot. You will iteratively refine the co-pilot based on feedback and insights gained from the user studies. The findings will be documented in a comprehensive master's thesis that outlines the development process, evaluation results, and potential impact of the AI co-pilot for authoring accessible web content."
