# short description of the publication
motivation: "Gait has been extensively explored as a marker for movement disorders. There are several projects collecting datasets from participants through wrist accelerometry and seeking to classify gait instances, and derive measures that can help monitoring disease fluctuations. However, people with Parkinson's disease have very individualized gait patterns (and fluctuations) and a generalized approach is sub-optimal."

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to explore a personalized approach for gait identification, with an approach focused on real-world usage. First, you will design and develop an application to support the collection and annotation of gait data. Second, you will explore different approaches to identify gait instances and derive measures (e.g., step length) from them. The project will be done in collaboration with Campus Neurol√≥gico Senior and, if successful, will be included into the Datapark platform (developed by us and used at this center for 3+ years)."
