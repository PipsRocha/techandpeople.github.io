# short description of the publication
motivation: "In a university setting, the accessibility of learning materials is crucial to ensure that all students, including those with disabilities, have equal access to education. However, the process of creating accessible learning materials can be time-consuming and resource-intensive for educators and support staff. There is a pressing need to automate and streamline the production of accessible learning materials, leveraging technology to improve efficiency, consistency, and inclusivity.
By automating the production of accessible learning materials, universities can significantly enhance the educational experience for students with disabilities. Automated processes can generate alternative formats, such as accessible PDFs, audio transcripts, and tactile graphics, from the original content, reducing the manual effort required from instructors. Moreover, automation can help ensure adherence to accessibility standards and guidelines, such as WCAG 2.1, by incorporating accessibility checks and remediation techniques into the production workflow.
The automation of accessible learning materials also benefits instructors and universities by freeing up valuable time and resources. Educators can focus more on designing engaging and interactive learning experiences while relying on automated tools to handle the accessibility aspects. Furthermore, universities can demonstrate their commitment to inclusivity and accessibility by implementing automated systems that facilitate the prompt and consistent delivery of accessible materials to all students.
By exploring the automation of accessible learning materials in a university setting, we aim to improve the accessibility of educational resources, reduce the burden on instructors, and enhance the educational experience for students with disabilities. This research will contribute to the development of efficient and scalable solutions that promote inclusivity, equality, and academic success for all learners.
This work will be conducted in collaboration with GAPsi - Gabinete de Apoio Psicol√≥gico da FCUL."

work: "During the thesis, you will focus on automating the production of accessible learning materials in a university setting. You will conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing manual processes for creating accessible materials, identifying bottlenecks and challenges. Based on the analysis, you will design and develop automated workflows and tools that generate accessible formats, such as accessible PDFs or audio transcripts. You will integrate accessibility checks and remediation techniques into the automation process, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards. You will conduct user testing and gather feedback to refine the automation system and evaluate its effectiveness. The final outcome will be an automated solution that streamlines the production of accessible learning materials, benefiting both students with disabilities and educators."
