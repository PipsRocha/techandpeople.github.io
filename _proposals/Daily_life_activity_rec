# short description of the publication
motivation: "Parkinson's Disease affects a lot of people, mainly the elderly, worldwide.Clinicians would benefit from having more information about patientsâ€™ daily life. Appointments are not frequent, generally, and there is limited awareness of the fluctuations happening thoughout the days, weeks, and months. Activities of daily life can help in capturing details about the disease stage and give clues about possible future problems. Adding to this, capturing thin details about each activity can give more clues about the patients' disease states."

work: "You will explore methods for collecting data in real environments towards building a dataset of activities of daily living for people with PD. After that, you will work towards, first, automatically recognizing those activities, and second, infer fluctuations from daily inertial sensing of those activities.
