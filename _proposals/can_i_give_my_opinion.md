# short description of the publication
motivation: "Online surveys have become a ubiquitous tool for gathering data and insights across various domains, ranging from research studies to customer feedback. However, the accessibility of these survey tools remains a significant concern, as individuals with disabilities may encounter barriers that hinder their ability to participate fully. There is a critical need to develop an accessible online survey tool that ensures inclusivity and equal access for all respondents.
Building an accessible online survey tool holds immense importance in promoting inclusive data collection practices. By incorporating accessibility features, such as support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, alternative text for images, and proper colour contrast, the tool can accommodate individuals with visual impairments, motor disabilities, cognitive limitations, and other accessibility needs. Furthermore, it should adhere to accessibility guidelines and standards, such as WCAG 2.1, to ensure a high level of usability and compatibility with assistive technologies.
An accessible online survey tool will benefit not only individuals with disabilities but also survey creators, researchers, and organisations seeking reliable and representative data. It will enable researchers to gather diverse perspectives and insights from a broader population, ensuring that no one is excluded from participating due to accessibility barriers. Additionally, organisations and businesses can demonstrate their commitment to inclusivity by using an accessible survey tool to collect feedback from all their stakeholders.
By building an accessible online survey tool, we aim to bridge the accessibility gap in data collection practices and empower individuals with disabilities to participate fully in surveys. This tool will promote inclusivity, enhance the quality and reliability of survey data, and contribute to a more equitable and accessible digital environment."

work: "During the thesis, you will focus on building an accessible online survey tool. You will conduct a thorough analysis of existing survey tools, identifying accessibility barriers and limitations. Based on the findings, you will design and develop an online survey tool that incorporates accessibility features, such as support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, alternative text for images, and color contrast compliance. User testing will be conducted to evaluate the tool's usability and effectiveness for individuals with disabilities. You will iterate and refine the tool based on user feedback, ensuring its compatibility with assistive technologies and adherence to accessibility guidelines. The final outcome will be a functional and accessible online survey tool that promotes inclusivity in data collection practices."
