# short description of the publication
motivation: "Entertainment as a whole in modern society, started to be recognized as a fundamental part of our lives and well-being. Gaming has a long list of potential benefits including coping with anxiety, social bonding or as a creative outlet. 
While there is a vast array of options available for playing together, players are very limited  in the experiences they are able to share when there is a significant difference in skill, ability, gaming tastes among others."

work: "In our group we have been exploring leveraging asymmetric game roles to create opportunities for shared play. In this topic you will have the opportunity to delve deeper into the design of Asymmetric Games and tackle one of the three challenges:

1) Competitive Game for Mixed Visual Ability; 
2) Balancing Differences in Skill; 
3) Ensuring Engagement & a Sense Shared Play"
