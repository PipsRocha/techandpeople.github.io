# short description of the publication
motivation: "Several aspects of our lives have been democratized (e.g., social networks democratized access and delivery of information, 3D printers enabled anyone to create and share models for new physical interfaces - Thingiverse). Conversely, one crucial aspect remains out of bounds to individual agency: the User Interface. Today, we are still stuck with the interfaces developers/designers thought to be the ones that best served our/their interests. "

work: "In this thesis, you will build a platform that is able to create changes to webpage styles. These changes will be stored on top of a github project enabling these new designs to be used by others, shared, and forked. This approach will also enable changes to the base UI to be accounted for and propagated to subsequent repositories enabling the long-term usage of the designs. We have already explored having a browser extension that is able to edit webpages and store design changes. This project will be able to grow that proof of concept to be a full-fledged community platform. The work will be done in collaboration with Northumbria University"
