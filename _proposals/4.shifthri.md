# short description of the publication
motivation: "Older adults are often limited in achieving the tasks they wish to do due to motor, sensorial, or cognitive decline. Technology, and particularly robots, are often created with stereotypical views of what older adults need: robots that try to promote exercise, phsyical or cognitive, are often deployed in care homes, as well as robots that connect older adults with their family, on the initiative of the latter."

work: "In this thesis, the student will design and develop multimodal scenarios where older adults control a Temi robot to achieve the tasks they wish. The student will explore different ways to enable control of the robot: voice, tangibles, or touch interfaces. Through these innovative interfaces, several scenarios will be developed: asking the robot to deliver something to a friend in a care home, controlling the robot remotely form the care home to enable communication with a grandson at home, among others. The work will be done in the context of a CMU Portugal project, in collaboration with CMU (USA), ISR (Tecnico, Portugal), and care homes in Lisbon and Set√∫bal."
