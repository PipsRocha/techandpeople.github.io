# short description of the publication
motivation: "Mobile devices are the “Swiss Army Knives” of today. They support a wide range of tasks, enabling people to access a wealth of information and services through their extensive connectivity; they have the potential to empower people in everyday tasks. Unfortunately, apps are not accessible to all. In particular, people with disabilities and people who are not tech-savvy, often have to struggle to learn how to use a new app, or to adapt to an update. Current store ratings reflect what the popular opinion about an application is, without any nuance evaluation. Comments are available but they can be overwhelming to parse and find the one that addresses these users concerns. "

work: "In this thesis you will be challenged to investigate what new metrics can be informative to users with disabilities and/or non tech-savvy users. You will have to develop a plugin/service that will overlay/interface with a current app store to provide this information. Throughout the work you will conduct user studies to inform the design of the solution proposed. The work will conclude with a user study evaluating the developed tool."
