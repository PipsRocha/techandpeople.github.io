# short description of the publication
motivation: "Mobile applications have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing convenience, information, and entertainment. However, individuals with disabilities often face accessibility challenges when navigating these applications, limiting their ability to fully engage and benefit from the digital experience. To ensure inclusivity and equal access, there is a critical need to improve the accessibility of mobile application's navigation mechanisms.
The navigation mechanisms within mobile applications serve as the backbone for users to interact with the content and functionality. However, many navigation designs may present barriers for individuals with disabilities, such as those with visual impairments, motor disabilities, or cognitive limitations. Common issues include complex gesture-based interactions, insufficient visual cues, and non-intuitive menu structures.
This research proposal aims to address these accessibility challenges and enhance the usability of mobile application navigation mechanisms for individuals with disabilities. It will involve the analysis of existing mobile applications and their navigation designs, identifying common accessibility issues and usability barriers, as well as assessing the ability of the WCAG to characterise these barriers.
Based on the findings, this research will focus on designing and implementing innovative approaches to improve navigation accessibility. This may include the development of alternative navigation methods, integrating assistive technologies, enhancing visual and auditory feedback, and optimising menu structures for improved usability.
User studies involving individuals with disabilities will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness, usability, and satisfaction of the proposed navigation enhancements. The insights gained from these studies will inform iterative refinements and validate the impact of the accessibility improvements.
By improving the accessibility of mobile application navigation mechanisms, this research will contribute to a more inclusive digital landscape, ensuring that individuals with disabilities can navigate and interact with mobile applications with ease, independence, and equal access to information and services."

work: "During the thesis, you will focus on improving the accessibility of mobile application navigation mechanisms. You will analyse existing mobile applications and identify common accessibility issues related to navigation. Based on the findings, you will design and implement innovative approaches to enhance navigation accessibility, such as alternative navigation methods, assistive technology integration, and improved visual and auditory feedback. User studies involving individuals with disabilities will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed navigation enhancements. You will iteratively refine the navigation mechanisms based on user feedback, leading to the development of accessible navigation guidelines and recommendations."
