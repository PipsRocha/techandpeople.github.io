# short description of the publication
motivation: "Robots have an enormous potential to support educational activities with children with mixed-abilities due to the sensing capabilities they can afford. Its predominant focus on visual feedback, however, limits its applicability for children with visual impairments. 
Our prior work with children with visual impairments and their educators identified the characteristics a Robot should have in order to be used by children with mixed-abilities, including: be easily heard and guide children throughout the activities; tactile cues to indicate head direction and sensors’ location; detect and give feedback on maps and objects; rewarding children’s’ actions; among others.  The goal of this thesis is to design and develop an inclusive robot (which may be based on existing robots) by allowing it to be felt, listened, inspected and followed."

work: "You will design, develop, and evaluate an inclusive robot for educational activities of children with mixed-abilities. You will conduct user studies early on through co-design sessions with children and educators in order to define requirements, aesthetics, tactile and auditory cues. Co-design sessions may include techniques such as crafting, role-play, fiction, among others.  This work will conclude with a user study evaluating the robot and its functionalities. "
