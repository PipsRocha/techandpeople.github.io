# short description of the publication
motivation: "Mobile devices are the “Swiss Army Knives” of today. They support a wide range of tasks, enabling people to access a wealth of information and services through their extensive connectivity; they have the potential to empower people in everyday tasks.
	
Often we rely on our phones to follow all sorts of “recipes”, for example cooking, tutorial steps for a particular software, hardware configuration, assembly furniture and so on. While some of these are professionally created instructions, often we are dealing with authored content on blogs, cooking websites, online communities and even instructions written by colleagues,  friends and family.

For blind people, it is common for recipes (e.g. tech instructions) and other instructions to be passed along within the community and on a user to user basis. However, creating, disseminating and consuming this information strictly on a smartphone has its challenges. For example, following these recipes on a phone while focusing on the primary task causes additional challenges. "

work: "In this thesis, you will be challenged to create an online platform to create “recipes” to be shared and consumed through smartphones and voice assistants such as Google Mini or Amazon Alexa."
