# short description of the publication
motivation: "People with Parkinson's disease have several motor fluctuations during the day. There are normally associated with response to medication; when medication starts to wear off, symptoms start to be more visible. Detecting these changes is relevant to assess the state of the disease but also to allow clinicians to adapt medication plans."

work: "In this work, the student will resort to data from accelerometer sensors used by people with PD in their daily lives to assess motor fluctuations. The student will have access to datasets of people with PD with accelerometer data and an annotated ground truth. The objective will be to create a model that is able to predict motor fluctuations. The work will be done in collaboration with Campus Neurológico Sénior."
