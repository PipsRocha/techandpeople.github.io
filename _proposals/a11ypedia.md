# short description of the publication
motivation: "Assistive technology plays a crucial role in empowering individuals with disabilities to overcome barriers and enhance their independence and participation in various aspects of life. However, accessing comprehensive and up-to-date information about assistive technology can be challenging for users, developers, and evaluators alike. There is a pressing need to build a centralised knowledge repository that provides reliable, accessible, and comprehensive information about assistive technology.
By building a knowledge repository, we can create a valuable resource that consolidates information about assistive technology devices, software, and accessibility features. This repository will cater to the needs of different stakeholders, including individuals with disabilities seeking information about available assistive technology options, developers looking to understand best practices and guidelines for designing inclusive solutions, and evaluators seeking resources for assessing the effectiveness and usability of assistive technology.
The repository will include diverse content such as user guides, tutorials, technical specifications, case studies, accessibility standards, and community-driven content. 
By building a knowledge repository about assistive technology, we aim to address the information gap, empower individuals with disabilities, facilitate inclusive design practices, and promote the effective evaluation of assistive technology solutions. This resource will contribute to enhancing accessibility, promoting equality, and ultimately improving the lives of individuals with disabilities."

work: "During the thesis, you will focus on building a knowledge repository about assistive technology for users, developers, and evaluators. You will curate and consolidate comprehensive information about assistive technology devices, software, and accessibility features. You will conduct extensive research, gather relevant resources, and organise the repository's content. You will design and develop an accessible and user-friendly platform for accessing the repository. You will also engage with the assistive technology community, gather feedback, and iterate on the repository based on user needs. The final outcome will be a functional knowledge repository that serves as a valuable resource for individuals with disabilities, developers, and evaluators in the field of assistive technology."
