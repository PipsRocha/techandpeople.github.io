# short description of the publication
motivation: "VR headets are emerging in the market. These tools offer a degree of immersion like no other technology. The reaction of users to environments can also be sensed in realtime. With hardware like Emteq Pro, it is possible to create environments that expose people to triggering environments and assess their physiological response. This creates an immense opportunity to collect physiological response data and sense the response of users to environments without putting the person at risk."

work: "In this thesis, the student will be challenged to create environments for exposure therapy of children with anxiety. These environments will be created in collaboration with therapists and incrementally expose children to their triggers (in a controlled environment), assessing response and enabling personalised therapy adaptation. The work will include developing environments in Unity, working with VR headsets and physiological sensors (e.g., Emteq pro), and collaborating with psychologists and children in creating and testing the environments."
