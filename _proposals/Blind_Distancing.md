# short description of the publication
motivation: "Blind people can navigate independently by using their orientation and mobility skills as well as their travel aids - the white cane or the guide dog. The white cane allows its users to identify obstacles/objects and open pathways in order to navigate safely, while the guide dog can follow the user's instructions while avoiding obstacles and dangerous situations. While extremely helpful, these two mobility aids fall short on supporting blind people when current instructions are to keep physical distance greater than two meters from each other: the white cane can only detect obstacles (or people!) at close distance, and a guide dog is completely unaware of social distancing guidelines."

work: "In this thesis, we aim to investigate the challenges that blind people face due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on their difficulties to keep physical distancing. You will conduct user studies early on to understand users’ needs and preferences in order to co-design technological solutions allowing them to keep physical distance while maintaining their autonomy and independence.
Then, you will design, develop, and evaluate a technological solution that supports the needs of blind people in a Social Distancing Era."
