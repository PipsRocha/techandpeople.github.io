# short description of the publication
motivation: "Robots have been a popular research tool in education because they are attractive and relevant to learn complex concepts. The use of robots increases engagement in social and collaborative actions which may also effectively impact children's social development and learning. Besides the fact that robots are now widely available and affordable, minorities are still set apart, and we have still not reached a state where visually impaired children can autonomously interact with a robot. Our previous work focused on creating solutions to bridgethis gap by enabling children with visual impairments to interact with a robot.
"

work: "In this project, you will focus on co-designing, with educators and children with mixed-visual-abilities, inclusive and collaborative environments for situated making and introductory programming class activities (that may build on our previous work). The goal will be to have an accessible tangible programming environment and a set of activities that can be deployed in different disciplines. You will build a setup and deploy it in an inclusive school, assessing its impact over a n-month deployment (optionally, depending on time and confinement restrictions, deployments can be individual and shipped to the children’s home, with their parent’s cooperation)."
