# short description of the publication
motivation: "Current software development techniques are guided by designers or developers who are responsible for designing, developing and running tests on the interface. Usually, the consequence is a one-size-fits-all solution aimed at an average user.  Many of these solutions and design choices do not take into account the individual preferences and needs. Personalization of interactive systems aims to provide users more control of interface features in order to better meet their needs. This approach has been explored in previous work but struggled to emerge as an accepted practice. In todayâ€™s UIs, we can witness support for some of these adaptations (e.g., zooming in and out a webpage, or changing its contrast). However, when users access a webpage or application, the way in which it is adjusted to their abilities and preferences is almost nonexistent."

work: "In this thesis, the student will be challenged to explore the benefits and limitations of end-user personalization of web interfaces. Users should be able to change interface attributes such as colors, text, size, or reorder structural elements, for instance. The student will  be able to choose the tools and languages to be used. One possibility is using GSS (https://gss.github.io) to create user contraints and apply them over web page constraints through a browser extension. This thesis will include the design, development, and evaluation of the approach with end-users. The work will be done in collaboration with researchers from Northumbria University, UK."
