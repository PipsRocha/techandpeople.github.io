# short description of the publication
motivation: "In recent years, large language models, such as GPT-3.5, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. These models have the potential to address various challenges, including those related to accessibility. Accessibility barriers on the web pose significant obstacles for individuals with disabilities, affecting their ability to access and navigate online content. While efforts have been made to enhance web accessibility, manual remediation of accessibility issues can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
This research proposal aims to investigate the abilities of large language models in addressing web accessibility barriers and proposes the development of a browser extension as a practical solution. By leveraging the advanced language understanding and generation capabilities of these models, the browser extension will aim to automatically identify and rectify accessibility issues on web pages in real-time. This can include providing alternative text for images, improving semantic structure, enhancing keyboard navigation, and addressing other accessibility guidelines.
The development of such a browser extension has the potential to significantly improve web accessibility by automating the process of identifying and fixing accessibility barriers. By reducing the reliance on manual remediation, it can save time and resources for website owners and developers, making accessibility more feasible and scalable. Furthermore, it can empower individuals with disabilities by providing a more inclusive and accessible online experience.
This research endeavour will contribute to the advancement of web accessibility technologies, utilising the capabilities of large language models to address accessibility barriers effectively and efficiently."

work: "During the thesis, you will investigate the abilities of large language models, such as GPT-3.5, to address web accessibility barriers. You will conduct a comprehensive analysis of common accessibility issues on the web and explore how these models can be utilised to automatically identify and rectify these barriers. You will then develop a browser extension that leverages the language model's capabilities to provide real-time accessibility enhancements to web pages. You will evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the extension through user testing and gather feedback for further improvements. You will document their findings and development process in the master's thesis, contributing to the field of web accessibility and large language model applications."
