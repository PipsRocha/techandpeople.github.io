The <strong><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/">Tech&People</a></strong> group is always on the lookout for enthusiastic candidate members with multidisciplinary backgrounds. In our work, we embed ourselves in the contexts we are designing for (formative studies<sup><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus/#studies">1</a></sup>), we design and build web<sup><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus/#web">2</a></sup>, mobile<sup><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus/#mobile">3</a></sup>, wearable<sup><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus/#wearable">4</a></sup>, robotic<sup><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus/#robotic">5</a></sup>, gaming<sup><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus/#gaming">6</a></sup>, and tangible<sup><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/joinus/#tangible">7</a></sup> interactive systems, and we evaluate them with target users. If you join our group it is likely that you will work closely with end-users, collaborate with a multidisciplinary team (engineers, designers, data scientists, psychologists, clinicians), build novel and impactful interactive systems, eventually publish and present your work internationally, and see your project being used in real-life contexts.

<strong><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team/saa.html">Sérgio Alves</a></strong> performed his master thesis in 2017 when he developed <a href="https://tjvguerreiro.github.io/pubs/w4a_scrapbook.pdf" target="_blank">Scrapbook</a>, a web platform to enable agile biographic reminiscence therapy, which was used for more than a year in national clinical institutions and care homes (that he presented at the WebForAll conference in San Francisco). Before starting his PhD, he was hired as an engineer in the group to maintain and improve Scrapbook, and was then hired by the Openlab (UK) to maintain the collaboration with Tech&People. He is now researching citizen-led experimentation of user interfaces (advised by Tiago Guerreiro and co-advised by Kyle Montague, Openlab, UK).

<strong><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team/afpr.html">André Rodrigues</a></strong> performed his master thesis in 2014 working on system-wide assistive technologies. In this work, besides a <a href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~tjvg/amc/spatialtouch/tablets_chi2015.pdf" target="_blank">novel tablet two-handed text-entry method for blind people</a>, he was able to provide a mobile phone access solution to Miguel, a tetraplegic blind young man. He presented his MSc work at BCS HCI in Southport, UK and at CHI (the best international conference in Human-Computer Interaction), in South Korea. After that, he pursued his PhD (LASIGE’s and DI’s Best PhD Student Award 2 times in a row), focusing on human-powered solutions for smartphone accessibility. From his many contributions, we outline TinyBlackBox, a Android mobile logger for user studies that enabled a <a href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~tjvg/amc/tbb/adoption.pdf" target="_blank">longitudinal study with blind people</a>, and has been integrated in the popular AWARE framework. During his PhD, he spent 3 months at Newcastle University, where we collaborated in the development of an IVR health system that is now being explored in a variety of contexts. He is now a PosDoc scholar in the group focusing on accessibility, gaming, and virtual reality.

<strong><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team/hhss.html">Hugo Simão</a></strong> is an industrial designer doing his master thesis on robots to support people with dementia. In this process, he designed and developed MATY, a multisensorial robot that is able to project images, emit fragrances, sounds, and walk around autonomously. He published his preliminary work at CHI 2019, in Glasgow, and other parallel projects on robots for older adults (e.g., Carrier-pigeon robot at HRI 2020). Hugo is starting his PhD in the group in the next semester, and was accepted for a 6-month internship at Carnegie Mellon University (postponed due to Coronavirus).

# Frequently Asked Questions
<br>
<p class="card" style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
<strong>I am considering doing a thesis in the group but I am not sure I have the technical skills required. Am I required to know how to program wearables, develop games,  know computer vision, or how to resort to machine learning algorithms?</strong><br><br>
We are a human-computer interaction research group with a strong technical component. Besides working with end-users, we build robust user-facing interactive systems to be evaluated in realistic settings. However, the group already has a set of skills that enables newcomers to have a swift onboarding experience. When needed, we provide internal workshops, pair master students with more experienced researchers, and provide constant support. The group also includes designers, engineers, and a psychologist, to provide support to projects that go beyond the expected knowledge of a student.
</p>
<p class="card" style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
<strong>What are the future prospects for a student doing a master’s with your group?</strong><br><br>
User research and user interface development are of the most desired expertise in the market of today. If you search for job offers, you will consistently find user research positions among the most well paid. Our graduates, at the end of their masters, have only faced the challenge of selecting which offer they preferred. While some were eager to join the portuguese market (e.g., Feedzai, Farfetch), we also have ex-master students staying with us as engineers with competitive contracts, several joining us for a PhD, and some going abroad (e.g., Google, Newcastle University).
</p>
<p class="card" style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
<strong>I want a scholarship. Do you offer those?</strong><br><br>
The group is currently engaged in four european projects, 2 national projects, and several service contracts. Most of our students are supported by scholarships in those contexts. All students have the opportunity to apply to the LASIGE scholarships; at the end of those scholarships, according to how the work is going, some students are offered a continuation of their financial support. Some projects are supported from the start, if they are developed in the context of a funded project task. From the stories above, all students have been fully supported during their studies. In our current team, more than 50% of the students are supported by scholarships.
</p>
<p class="card" style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
<strong>What’s the deal with conference travels and internships? Do I have to pay for those?</strong><br><br>
No. Conference publications are fully supported by the group (travel, hotel, registration, per diem) when submission to the conference is agreed with your advisor. Internships are normally arranged with your advisors and the visited institution, and are also fully covered by funding schemes (e.g., Erasmus+)  or by the visited institution/company.
</p>
<p class="card" style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
<strong>I want to work in the X project but I will need Y technology and a PC with special hardware. Do you have those?</strong><br><br>
If a proposal requires specific tech/materials, it will be provided, including computers/laptops to work with them (if needed). The group already has access to a wide set of resources like eye-tracker, mobile devices, physiological computing kits, IoT kits, commodity robots, bluetooth beacons, VR headsets, as well as cloud computing, panel, and transcription services.
</p>
<p class="card" style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
<strong>How can I know more about the group?</strong><br><br>
You can check our publications, team and research pages, to have an idea of our published work and mission. We also invite you to check our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDw6lPcFfu1IUTPwS5Nv_vBPUv0JLH0AHETaloUc-AE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">lab memo</a> to have a feeling of how the group operates.

<strong>What do you expect from your students?</strong><br><br>
The group welcomes motivated strong-willed students to pursue impactful work. While it is expected that getting a position will be competitive in regards to a student's background, we are mostly looking for people that are motivated to work and to make a difference. If you just want to finish your masters in the easiest way possible, this is not the group you should be applying for. Conversely, if you are eager to learn a variety of skills, be challenged, be exposed to real life problems, and seek for fair and effective solutions to solve them, come work with us.
