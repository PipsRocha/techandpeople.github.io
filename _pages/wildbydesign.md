<h1>Workshop on Designing Ubiquitous Health Monitoring Technologies for Challenging Environments</h1>

<h3>At UbiComp, September 25th or 26th, Online</h2>

<p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
There is a growing focus on monitoring health in uncontrolled (aka in-the-wild) settings. This is partially due to the limitations of occasional formal assessments, and to the increasing availability of off-the-shelf sensing devices and applications. This change of paradigm promises fine-grained monitoring of chronic and neuro-degenerative diseases, early prediction of health conditions, accessible self-management, and the enablement of more effective personalised interventions. </p>

<p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
Despite this potential, there are still limited examples of ubiquitous health technologies used in practice for long periods of time. The majority of ubiquitous health technologies, although targeted at uncontrolled in-the-wild settings, are still mostly tested in the laboratory. Activity trackers are one successful example of a technology that became mainstream. However, it also faces problems with abandonment and adoption and misalignment with user requirements and goals. Although the need for longitudinal in-the-wild studies has been established, the challenges of engaging and sustaining participation has only been surfaced. Awareness and knowledge of this and other challenges for in-the-wild health monitoring is still very limited.

<h1 id="cfp">Call For Papers</h1>

<p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
The main goal of this workshop is to bridge cross-disciplinary relationships between researchers and practitioners interested in the design, development, and deployment of ubiquitous technologies for health monitoring. Which major challenges arise in in-the-wild deployments of ubiquitous technology? How can the streams of data be manageable for end-users and health professionals? What are the best practices for engaging and sustainable participation in longitudinal deployments? Which are socio-economic, cultural and individual factors of influence?
</p>

<p style="padding-left:20px; padding-right:20px; padding-bottom: 25px; margin-bottom:0 ">
To answer these example questions and others, we hope to bring together the ubiquitous computing, sensor development, machine learning, digital health, clinical, HCI and accessibility communities. Through this workshop, participants will be able to share real-life deployment experiences, tools, challenges, and discuss designs and technology goals for future research.
